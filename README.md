TODO:

1: ADD a simulation routine.


Known bug(s):

1: Pressing the expand button on the Observations and vForecastComp vectors in a HARforecast object provides an error I can't seem to figure out. Luckily the vectors are accessible through `HARforecast$Observations` and `HARforecast$vForecastComp` respectively.
