  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.2
  *NAMESPACE (exports):No longer exports HARDataCreationC
  *NAMESPACE importFrom("methods" , "missingArg") added
  *Added HAR-J, HARQ, and HARQ-J models to estimation and forecasting
  *Add ellipsis to plotting to increase user control
  *Improve plotting routines by using xts
  *Bug fix in forecasting.
  *Forecasts are now output as a named matrix
  *Remove function HARMonteCarlo
  *Rewrote the datacreation function with the armadillo library and optimized it - this increased the speed of the this step by almost 50%
